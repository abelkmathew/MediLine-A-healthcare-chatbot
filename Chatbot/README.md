# RASA Powered Healthcare Chatbot
The Chatbot is built using the RASA framework. Users accesses the chatbot via the hospital webpage. A machine learning model is integrated within the framework which will be doing a preliminary analysis based on the symptoms provide by the user. After the preliminary analysis, a disease to department mapping will be done which will then list out the availability of doctors and their respective time slots to the user. Once the user confirms a particular slot based on his convenience, a confirmation message will be displayed and the details of the patient along with the symptoms will be stored in the database which will later be used to generate a report which would be available to the doctor on the day of appointment.
