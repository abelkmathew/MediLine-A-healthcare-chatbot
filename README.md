# MediLine-A-healthcare-chatbot


## Problem Statement
Hospitals need an improvement over the conventional system and there is a need for
an automated online system to handle patients requiring appointments and looking for
quick diagnosis.

## Summary
The primary goal of this project was to create a chatbot for patients which will predict
the disease from the user input by use of an ML model. After the disease diagnosis, the
patient has the option to select the doctor available for that department, then the user
can select the date and time for appointment according to the doctors availability. After
selecting the time slot the appointment for the user is booked.
An added functionality ’Emergency Services’ is also provided by the chatbot in cases
where the patient requires immediate services. In this case an emergency sms and a call
will go to the admin that the user requires emergency services and has to be contacted
immediately using his/her given contact detail.
